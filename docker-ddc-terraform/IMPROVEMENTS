- Have each instance clone this repository and run Ansible remotely.
  * Imposes less load on the instance running terraform (i.e. my laptop)
  * Yields faster deployment times.

- Have each module be in their own repository.
  * Makes it easier to reuse stuff for multiple Terraform configurations.
  * Can develop modules outside of configuration cycle.
