*/ Terraform doesn't have very good semantics for expressing things that
are dynamically created during a plan, such as intermediate variables. Given
that our ELB needs to know in advance which AZs it will be serving traffic to,
but that list of AZs depends on the number_of_azs_to_use variable, this affects
us in that there's no immediate way of modifying the list of AZs provided
into the elb resource.

So we hack around it by creating three load balancer resources and setting a condition
on which one to use depending on the number_of_azs_to_use parameter. */
